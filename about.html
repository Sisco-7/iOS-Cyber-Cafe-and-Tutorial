            <h2>History</h2>
        <p style="color: red;"><b>Founded in 2015, iOS Cyber Café and Online JAMB Tutorial platform began as a small community initiative aimed at providing affordable internet services and educational resources to students preparing for their JAMB exams. Recognizing the challenges many students faced in accessing quality preparatory materials and reliable online tools, we set out to bridge the gap with a dual-purpose service.

            Over the years, we have evolved into a trusted hub for academic excellence and digital connectivity. Our cyber café offers a serene and well-equipped environment for research, browsing, and online tasks. Meanwhile, our JAMB tutorial program leverages experienced instructors, up-to-date syllabi, and interactive sessions to ensure our students excel in their examinations.
            
            With thousands of students mentored and countless success stories, we remain committed to empowering the next generation of scholars and professionals through technology and education.
